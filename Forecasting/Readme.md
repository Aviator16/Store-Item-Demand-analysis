# Forecasting on entire original train dataset
We take the original train set of sales upto year 2017 for items 1 to 50 in stores 1 to 10 and try to fit suitable SARIMA models to each store-item combination.
The program can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Aviator16/Store-Item-Demand-analysis/blob/main/Forecasting/6_%20forecasting%20on%20entire%20original%20dataset.R).

#### Here we make use of the parsimony principle and try to select the model that yeilds best results with minimum parameters.
