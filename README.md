# Store-Item-Demand-analysis

This is a data science project for demand analysis of items in stores. The data is a **Multiple time series data** where we have 500 combinations of stores and items and are required to forecast thier sales. I have used **Time Series Forcasting** for the purpose of this project. The project has been done in **R Studio**. Different parts of the project have been saved in R notebooks and are available in this repository.

I have used correlation analysis and SARIMA models for the purpose of modeling and forecasting the time series data.

# Exploring the dataset
This part is carried out [here](https://github.com/Aviator16/Store-Item-Demand-analysis/tree/main/Dataset%20Exploration).
We find that the dataset has 10 stores and 50 items and sales of all combinations of these need to forecasted for this project.
